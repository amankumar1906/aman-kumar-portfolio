This is the source code for my personal portfolio website â€” a single-page, animated site that showcases my background as a Full Stack & AI Engineer. It includes my professional timeline, featured projects, and a contact form powered by FormSubmit (no backend needed). Built with a focus on clarity, responsiveness, and subtle visual polish.
